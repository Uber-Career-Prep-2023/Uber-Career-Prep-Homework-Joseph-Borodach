- In some states, it is not possible to drive between any two towns because they are not connected to the same road network. 
- Given a list of towns and a list of pairs representing roads between towns, return the number of road networks. 
- (For example, a state in which all towns are connected by roads has 1 road network, and a state in which none of the towns are connected by roads has 0 road networks.)
