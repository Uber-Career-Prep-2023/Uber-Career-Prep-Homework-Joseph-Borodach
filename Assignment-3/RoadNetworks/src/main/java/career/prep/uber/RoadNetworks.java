 * Question #6:
 *      In some states, it is not possible to drive between any two towns because they are not connected to the same road network.
 *      Given a list of towns and a list of pairs representing roads between towns, return the number of road networks.
 *      (For example, a state in which all towns are connected by roads has 1 road network, and a state in which none of the towns are connected by roads has 0 road networks.)
 *
 * Model for the Problem:
 *      - The problem can be modeled as a Undirected Edge Graph,
 *      where towns are verticies and roads are edges.
 *      - The question essentially asks: How many forests or disconnected graphs are there in the network?
 *
 * Approaches:
 *
