- A priority queue functions like a queue except that elements are removed in order of priority rather than insertion. 
- This is typically implemented as a max heap that stores pairs of elements and numeric weights, with the weights used as the values in the heap. 
- Implement a priority queue according to the following API using a heap as the underlying data structure. 
- For simplicity, you can assume the priority queue stores string elements with integer priorities. 
- Start by copy-pasting your heap implementation from question 2 and making modifications.
