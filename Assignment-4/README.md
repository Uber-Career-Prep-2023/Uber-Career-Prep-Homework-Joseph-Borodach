# Part 2: “10%” Technique Problems
## 2: Boggle
- [Implementation Class](https://github.com/Uber-Career-Prep-2023/Uber-Career-Prep-Homework-Joseph-Borodach/blob/main/Assignment-4/Boggle/src/main/java/career/prep/uber/Boggle.java)
- [Test Class](https://github.com/Uber-Career-Prep-2023/Uber-Career-Prep-Homework-Joseph-Borodach/blob/main/Assignment-4/Boggle/src/test/java/career/prep/uber/BoggleTests.java)
- Boggle is a word game in which players compete to find the most words on a square grid of random letters.
- Valid words must be at least three characters and formed from non-overlapping (i.e., a position on the board can only be used once in a word) adjacent (including diagonal) letters.
- Given a Boggle board and a dictionary of valid words, return all valid words on the board.
- Example:
