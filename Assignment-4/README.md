- Implement a trie class, including the insert, search, and delete methods.
- Your class should adhere to the following API, adjusted appropriately for your language of choice.

# Part 2: “10%” Technique Problems
## 2: Boggle

- Boggle is a word game in which players compete to find the most words on a square grid of random letters.
- Valid words must be at least three characters and formed from non-overlapping (i.e., a position on the board can only be used once in a word) adjacent (including diagonal) letters.
- Given a Boggle board and a dictionary of valid words, return all valid words on the board.
- Example:

## 4: Catalan Numbers

- The Catalan numbers are a mathematical sequence of numbers. The nth Catalan number is defined as (2n)! / (n+1)!n!. Given a non-negative integer n, return the Catalan numbers 0-n.
- Examples:
  - Input: 1
    - Output: 1, 1
  - Input: 5
    - Output: 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42

## 5: MinCostStairClimbing

- A staircase on a hiking trail implements a rather unusual toll system to cover trail maintenance costs.
- Each stair in the staircase has a different toll which you only have to pay if you step on that stair.
- Due to the height of the stairs, you can only climb one or two stairs at once.
- This means that from the ground you must initially step on either stair 0 or stair 1 and that, if there are n stairs, the last stair you step on can be either stair n-1 or n-2.
- Given an array representing the costs per stair, what is the minimum possible toll you can pay to climb the staircase?
- Examples:
  - Input: [4, 1, 6, 3, 5, 8]
    - Output: 9 (step on stairs 1, 3, 4 for a cost of 1+3+5)
  - Input: [11, 8, 3, 4, 9, 13, 10]
    - Output: 25 (step on stairs 1, 3, 5 for a cost of 8+4+13)

- Given a string of characters without spaces and a dictionary of valid words, determine if it can be broken into a list of valid words by adding spaces.

- Given a square matrix of 0s and 1s, find the dimension of the largest square consisting only of 1s.
