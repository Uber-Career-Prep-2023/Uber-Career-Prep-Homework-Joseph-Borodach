/**
 * Instructions:
 *      In each of the methods, use pointers in languages that support pointers (e.g., Node * in C++) or references in languages that support references (e.g., Python).
 *      Your Node struct will be the same as for your doubly linked list except the two pointers/references should be left and right rather than next and prev.
 *      Note that the delete method is more difficult than the insert method; you wonâ€™t need it for the rest of the assignment so either stop or get help from your mentor if you are stuck after 40 minutes.
 *
 * Design comments:
 *      Originally, began implementing a balanced tree,
 *      but then decided that was not what the question was asking for
 *      and testing would need to be more extensive.
 *
 * Potential improvements:
 *      1. Use a balanced tree (AVL, red-black tree, etc.)
 *      2. Use an array or list to store the data instead of Node objects.
 *          Since the requirements are so simple, this would improve time & space slightly.
 *          But this does just sound like a different problem.
 *      3. Personally, I think that it would make more sense for the delete method to return a boolean or void.
